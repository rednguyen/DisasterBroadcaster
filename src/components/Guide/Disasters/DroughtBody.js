Check with your local water agency to see if there is a rebate available for the purchase of a smart controller.

                        <li className="list">Take short showers instead of baths. Turn on the water only to get wet and lather and then again to rinse off.</li>

                        <li className="list">Store drinking water in the refrigerator. Do not let the tap run while you are waiting for water to cool.
                        </li>

                        <li className="list">Avoid using running water to thaw meat or other frozen foods. Defrost food overnight in the refrigerator or use the defrost setting on your microwave.
                        </li>

                        <li className="list">Operate clothes washers only when they are fully loaded or set the water level for the size of your load.
                        </li>

                            <li className="list">A heavy rain eliminates the need for watering for up to two weeks. Most of the year, lawns only need one inch of water per week.</li>
                            <li className="list">If your lawn does require watering, do so early in the morning or later in the evening, when temperatures are cooler.</li> 
                            <li className="list">In extreme drought, allow lawns to die in favor of preserving trees and large shrubs.
